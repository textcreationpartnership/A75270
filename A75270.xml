            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>there is none that ſeeketh after God, in whom only is all Happineſs.</hi> And this is the common caſe of all the world in their natural condition, as the Apoſtle infers and proves, <hi>Rom. 3.9-19.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though all are not of equal Ignorance or Impiety; but ſome by Nature, Art, and Induſtry, are of clearer Intellects, and more ſublimated Capacities, to know, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, diſcuſs, and determine matters of weighty importance, as well <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> and

               </gap> Her Reply was, <hi>Well, But do you ſo, when I am not here.</hi> And the Day before ſhe died,
<hi>She</hi> named the <hi>very Day</hi> upon which ſhe ſhould be
<hi>interred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to her uſefulneſs in <hi>civil</hi> things: For her
<hi>Sempſtry;</hi> She was well-grounded in all the <pb n="25" facs="tcp:150002:24"/>grounds of it, ſo that what piece of Work ſoever ſhe had ſeen, it was not tedious to her to take it in; as her many <hi>pretty</hi> Works, left behind her, do amply teſtifie: So for her <hi>Houſe-wifery,</hi> her
<hi>Gravity</hi> in that point beſpoke her to be almoſt <hi>double</hi> her Age. Seldom hath one of her Age been known to have ſuch a <hi>frugal</hi> Forecaſt and quick <hi>Inſight</hi> into the managing of
<hi>Domeſtical</hi> Affairs, both with <hi>Neatneſs</hi> and
<hi>Frugality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She would not ſee any empty place in her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Houſe, but ſhe would have that furniſhed according to her Fathers ability; So that her
<hi>Hospitality</hi> and <hi>Frugality</hi> might be ſeen at once.</p>
            <p>She hath been often heard to ſay, <hi>She would not eat her Morſels alone;</hi> meaning when ſhe had ſomething more than ordinary Proviſion: And would alſo have deſired her Mother, <hi>To do good to all, especially to the houſhold of Faith.</hi> In a word, ſuch was her Induſtry in Houſhold-affairs, that the burden and care of the Family was almoſt quite taken of her Mother, which now makes the burden the greater in the want of her.</p>
            <p>As to her Father, put all her Accompliſhments together &amp; ſhe, ſhe was the Joy of his Heart; he hath been heard to ſay, That if he ſhould have publiſhed but the one half of the many Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of her exceeding great Uſefulneſs to him, both in <hi>Sacred</hi> and
<hi>Civil</hi> things, with her win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <pb n="26" facs="tcp:150002:25"/>and engaging Diſpoſition to him, many <hi>Sheets</hi> of <hi>Paper</hi> would not contain them.</p>
            <p>For when they have been under any <hi>frowning</hi> Providence, ſhe could have <hi>out-faith't</hi> him at any turn; And when ſhe had obſerved any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of trouble upon her Father, then ſhe would mind him of what the Lord had formerly done for him, backing it with ſome ſuitable <hi>Scripture;</hi> and as to her extraordinary Love to him, and tenderneſs over him it appeared very many waies.</p>
            <p>Her ordinary way of making mention of her Father's name in the Family, was, <hi>Where is my joy?</hi> or, <hi>Where is my jewel?</hi> And her Father being tender, and ſometime exerciſed under a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Diſtemper, many would have ſaid, That it made her look liker Death than her Father. She would ſometimes have ſaid, <hi>She ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver endure to ſee her Father die:</hi> And after his Fits had been over, and he pretty well again, yet for many Nights after, ſhe would riſe of her own accord, and come down in the dark <hi>Night,</hi> to ſee how her Father was; So that ſhe might well ſay of him, and he <hi>retort</hi> it back again in the words of good old <hi>Jacob</hi> concerning <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin, My life is lapt up in the Laſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as ſhe was a careful and conſtant Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former of her Duty both to God and Man, walking in all the Commandments of God, and ſerving the Lord in Holineſs and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, thereby becoming an uſeful Inſtrument, <pb n="27" facs="tcp:150002:25"/>while ſhe lived in health in her place and ſtation, ſo ſhe manifeſted much Piety towards God, quiet and chearful ſubmiſſion to his Will, and much Charity towards Man, much Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Chriſtian Prudence, Courage, and Hope, whilſt under her Death-bed Diſtemper; as will appear more at large by her <hi>Occaſional</hi> Speeches at that time; and at laſt She died in Peace, with much Aſſurance of God's Love, reſigning up her Soul to God, and falling aſleep in the Lord, the

            <p>AT that time when my Father was at <hi>London</hi> (which was in the Year aforeſaid) it was the good pleaſure of God to draw out my Affections to the Lord, and after the means of Grace; So that I often thought it long after one opportunity of Grace paſsed, till another came to be enjoyed.

And I had then very longing Deſires to read ſome good Books; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I was happily caſt upon Mr.
<hi>Brooks</hi> his Book entituled, <hi>Apples of Gold,</hi> &amp;c. By the reading of which, eſpecially ſome <hi>Motives</hi> to ſtir up young one<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to fear the Lord, the Lord was pleaſed to make them of Uſe, for the good of my Soul; As Firſt,
<hi>The Conſideration that Chriſt died for us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and why ſhould not we live to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times? O give not Chriſt cauſe to ſay, that I died for you betimes, why ſhould not you have lived to me betimes,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Who but Souls much left of God, and blinded by Satan, can hear the Lord Jeſus ſay, I laid down a Ranſom for ſome betimes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I ſatisfied Divine Juſtice betimes, I pacified my Fathers wrath betimes. Who can hear Chriſt reckon up all what he hath done for Souls, and not fall in Love and League with Chriſt, and for ever to be united to Chriſt, and for ever be one with Chriſt?</hi> And I thought the reading of theſe, and other Motives did more and more engage my heart to Chriſt. And then I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, That though I had made Conſcience before of committing the leaſt Sin, that I knew to be a Sin, yet I had not given up my ſelf to the Lord, in that ſerious manner that I ought to have done: <pb n="29" facs="tcp:150002:26"/>for I was too vain (as I now ſee) both in my Thoughts, Words and Actions, and went on ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely, and did not at all queſtion my Eſtate and Condition; nor did I ſee any thing of the evil of mine own heart, till the Lord was pleaſed to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it to me. And when I did endeavour to ſet my ſelf to any Duty, or to have my Meditations upon any thing that was good; then I found the ſtarting up of Sin in my Heart, and a woful Averſneſs and Backwardneſs in my heart to any thing that was good. And though I was ſenſible of ſomething that was my Duty to do, which (as I thought) I would have willingly done, yet when I came to it, it ſeemed burdenſome to me. Afterwards I read Mr. <hi>Shepheards Sincere Convert,</hi> by which the Lord was pleaſed to let me ſee, from whence all that backwardneſs in my heart did spring, the cauſe of which was that <hi>Original Sin</hi> that I brought into the world with me; And then it was the grief of my heart, that I could not be humbled for that Sin, as I ought to be: And it did the more grieve me, in that I had known it before by Queſtions that my Father had asked me about it, and yet it did but ſwim in my brain. I did not think that it was mine own Caſe in particular, nor did I apply it to mine own Heart; wherefore I did mourn, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I could not mourn enough for, and under ſuch an oppreſſing evil as this was to me. Whereupon the Lord gave me in theſe ſupporting <hi>Scriptures,</hi> Iſai. <hi>53.7. Let the wicked forſake his way, and <pb n="30" facs="tcp:150002:27"/>the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly pardon.</hi> Mat. <hi>11.28. Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you Reſt.</hi> Then I thought theſe were very ſweet <hi>Scriptures,</hi> but I had ſomething to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt my ſelf, that they did not belong unto me; becauſe I felt not the weight and burden of Sin, in that degree and meaſure, as I ought. Though I was ſenſible of Sin lying upon me, yet I thought Sin, as Sin, was not ſo real a burthen to me, as it ought to have been: And therefore I concluded, that I had no Right to ſuch Promiſes, but put them often away from me, till it pleaſed the Lord to ſet home that other <hi>Scripture</hi> upon my heart, Mat. <hi>12.20. A bruiſed reed ſhall he not break, and ſmoaking ſlax ſhall he not quench: till he ſend forth judgment unto Victory.</hi> And providentially reciting Mr. <hi>Love's Different De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Grace,</hi> I found that ſame place opened ſweetly, which told me to my encouragement,
<hi>That though there was much ſmoak of Infirmity, yet if there was but the leaſt breathings of Grace, the Lord would not quench it, but breath upon it, and increaſe it: And that he would not deſpiſe the Day of ſmall things.</hi> And by theſe things I was much encouraged and refreſhed.

            <p>Then ſhe began to ſpeak about her Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhe had at her firſt cloſing with Chriſt.

               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er, to improve their time. This was ſpoken and preſſed, with ſo much Earneſtneſs and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:150002:33"/>as was exceeding taking upon the hearts of all thoſe that heard her; ſtill ending with much Self-abaſement, deſiring ſome about her (if ſhe ſhould recover) to watch over her.</p>
            <p>The next Day, <hi>two</hi> of their Maids coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Room; She called them to her, and kiſſed them, and ſaid, <hi>Be good Laſſes.

            </p>
            <p>Soon after, her Father came to her, and asked her how ſhe did; She then told him, <hi>She was travelling for another world.</hi> And further ſaid, <hi>(My dear Father) If ever I have offended you in all my life, I pray you for give me.</hi> His ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heart being almoſt overwhelmed with grief, he told her, She rarely offended him in all her Life; nor could he ſay, he had any juſt cauſe to give her a Reproof. For if ſometimes (which yet was very ſeldom) occaſion of both were given, through infirmity, not wilfully, her ready and right ſence thereof, miniſtred ſuch ſatisfaction, as eaſily removed the offence, and prevented the Reproof. Judge then what deep Impreſſion their parting muſt needs have. She (then ſeeing him filled with anguiſh of heart, and not able to diſcourſe with her; which I am confident did loſe many Divine things, he might have had, had he been able to have kept up Diſcourſe with her) ſaid, <hi>My dear Father, as for you and <pb n="43" facs="tcp:150002:33"/>my dear Mother, my Life might be deſireable; and if it were the Will of the Lord, I could be willing to live, that I might pay that Debt I owe to you: But what God will have done, is beſt of all; and that I freely ſubmit to.</hi> Then pauſing a while, ſhe ſaid, <hi>I bleſs the Lord, that will preſently deliver me from</hi> two

            </p>
            <p>On <hi>Thurſday</hi> Night, She got little or no Reſt; For the
<hi>Silver cord was looſed, and the golden Bowl was almoſt broken.</hi> And on <hi>Friday</hi> Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, her Father being gone but a little from her, She ſent for him with ſpeed; At whoſe firſt coming, ſhe chearfully ſaid, <hi>My Dear Father, Let now who will be heir of</hi> Croſs-field:
<hi>For I am going to be an Heir with Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> She then taking notice of the ſad impreſſion it had upon him, ſaid, <hi>Father, Give me up freely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He then told her, he had fallen down before the Lord that

               <hi>But my Father</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>I pray you go again, and mind the Lord of that Covenant between you and him.</hi> But ſhe again taking notice of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nability to anſwer her, becauſe of Anguiſh of heart, ſaid, <hi>My Dear Father, Why can you not give me up freely?</hi> Abraham <hi>had but one Son, and he was the Seed of the Promiſe,</hi> (for it was ſaid, <hi>in him ſhould all Nations be bleſſed) and yet how freely could he offer him up? (My Dear Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:150002:34"/>give me up freely: and Jeſus Chriſt will be more to you than many Children. Father</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>you are but a weak man, and</hi> I <hi>am perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that another Winter will ſet my Mother hard to it; And as for you, (my Grand mother) it will not be long, till you will be with me. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make ready, and ſettle your Concerments in the world, aſſoon as you can, that you may not be toyled in the world; and then table your ſelves with</hi> Mr. Nicholſon Then ſhe calling to mind, that Mr.
<hi>Nicholſon</hi> was ſent for, asked <hi>If he was come?</hi> But he being gone upon a Viſit of the like nature, <hi>three</hi> Meſſengers were ſent for him, before he came, which made her think the time exceeding long for his coming; and often pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deſired others to pray, that ſhe might live to ſee his face, his precious face, that had been ſo Inſtrumental for the good of her Soul. Then ſhe cried again, <hi>This Death is hard to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide; Pray, pray that my Paſſage may be eaſy.</hi> Then ſhe called to their man <hi>Andrew,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Where is that Promiſe?</hi> I, <hi>even</hi> I <hi>will blot one thine iniquities, for my Names ſake: and will not remember thy Sins.</hi> Then he turned to the place,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.25. And many a time did ſhe go over theſe words, <hi>I, even I, am he, that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions, for my names ſake; and will not remember thy Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then pauſing a little, ſaid, <hi>Here will I reſt, for I have nothing elſe to rely upon, but Chriſt <pb n="45" facs="tcp:150002:34"/>in a Promiſe. As for all my beſt Duties, that ever I performed in all my life, I quit them all, as Phyſicians of no value; and do freely caſt my ſelf at the feet of Chriſt: And if I periſh, I'le pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh there.</hi> This was unſpeakable ſatisfaction to her Father, that now thoſe Sermons, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with difficulty ſhe had heard, and thoſe Duties ſhe had performed, and which had coſt her many a Tear, ſhould now be all diſowned by her as to Juſtification, when ſhe was going to look <hi>grim</hi> Death in the Face.</p>
            <p>And this her father affirms of his own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, ſhe was of ſuch a broken frame of Spirit, that ſeldom, or never, did ſhe come from her private Retirements, but with red Eyes, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery Cheeks. And ſometime, upon particular occaſion, he hath joyned with her in Prayer, when ſhe would have poured out her Soul, in ſuch a melting frame of Spirit, Heavenly lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and powerful Arguments, as would have cauſed him to have groaned in his Spirit: and bleſſed the Lord for thoſe eminent Endowments of Gifts and Graces he had endued her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</p>
            <p>Preſently ſhe cries again, <hi>Oh my Father, this Death is hard to abide: Pray, pray, that my Paſſage may be eaſie.</hi> Then ſuddenly, with much ardency of Spirit, with Hands and Eyes lift up to Heaven, ſaid, <hi>Lord Jeſus put forth thine Arm, and take me by the Hand, and ſay, <pb n="46" facs="tcp:150002:35"/>Come up hither.</hi> Then ſhe enquiring again for Mr. <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> ſhe was told he was not come. She prayed again, That if the Lord will, ſhe might live to ſee him. Then beholding her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhe ſaid, <hi>How comes it, that my Father is without a Cap?</hi> Then ſhe called for one, and ſat up, and opened it with her own hands, and then put it upon his Head, who ſaid, It was the laſt that ever his
<hi>dear</hi> would put him on.</p>
            <p>Then ſhe deſired to be remembred to all her natural Relations, leaving a word of Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them all; namely, <hi>That they ſhould come off from the world, and make ſure of Chriſt.</hi> Then ſhe deſired to be remembred to all Chriſtian Friends; and named ſome of them, ſaying,
<hi>Oh the Society of the Saints, the Society of the Saints! Were I to live again, I would more high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly value the Society of the Saints; the leaſt of Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then ſhe asked her Father, <hi>What day it was?</hi> He told her, <hi>Friday;</hi> Then ſhe ſaid, <hi>It will not be long, till I ſhall be in Eternity of Felicity; and I ſhall be interred upon the Lords day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then ſhe asked, <hi>If ſhe might give them out her Grave-dreſs?</hi> Which being referred to her liberty, ſhe called for her Desk, and ſat up, and opened it with her own hand, and laid aſide her Shift and the reſt of her Cloaths, that ſhe would carry with her to her Grave, being all plain. She deſired her Aunt to put her Fore-head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:150002:35"/>low upon her Brow. Then perceiving that this enflamed her Fatherwith Sorrow, with the reſt of her Relations, ſhe ſaid, <hi>Father, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall the Saints know one another in Heaven?</hi> Who then gave her that ſatisfaction he could on the <hi>Affirmative,</hi> and further called to mind, that Mr. <hi>Bolton,</hi> in his <hi>Joys of Heaven,</hi> doth poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively affirm the ſame by many Arguments; as firſt, <hi>That all Knowledg is deſirable, but to know one another in Heaven, is moſt deſireable,</hi> 1 Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin. 13.12. <hi>But then ſhall I know, even as I am known.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The Diſciples, in the</hi> Transfigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>knew</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Elias, <hi>whom they never ſaw before.</hi> Ergo <hi>we ſhall know one another in Heaven;</hi> with many more Arguments to that purpoſe: which were ſo ſatisfactory to her, that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he bleſſed the Lord for that knowledg, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that ſhe ſhould know her dear Father a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in Heaven.</p>
            <p>She further enquired, <hi>Whether the Sins of Saints ſhould come into the Judgment of Diſcuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at the great Day of the Lord?</hi> She then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring Mr. <hi>Brooks</hi> in his <hi>Apples of Gold,</hi> did ſpeak fully to it: and deſired it might be read to her, which accordingly was done. And when ſhe heard it, ſhe then bleſſed the Lord, ſaying,
<hi>whom he loves once, he loves to the end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Friend coming in, and asking her how ſhe did; ſhe ſaid,
<hi>She was taking flight into another <pb n="48" facs="tcp:150002:36"/>world: Pray, pray that my Paſſage may be eaſu,</hi> Then ſaid, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, take me to thy ſelf, hold me faſt in thine Arms, and let me not go.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then ſhe enquired again for Mr. <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> who preſently came, and after Salutation, he fell down before the Lord, to beg Mercy for her Soul. After Prayer was done, ſhe deſired that the Room might be ſpared, that ſhe might have a little private Converſe with him. He ſpent about half an hour with her, which (as he after told) was moſtly about ſome Doubts ſhe had about the ſtrength of her Corruptions, and want of Aſſurance.</p>
            <p>In the cloſe of their Diſcourſe, ſhe was ſtill of that mind, that ſhe would die: He told her, others were fitter to judg in that Caſe than ſhe; And asked her how ſhe knew it? She then ſaid, <hi>She felt that, that he did not feel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So in the cloſe of the Day, ſhe fell into a ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> after, ſhe fell upon a ſweet ſleep (as the Docto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> There is a <hi>twofold</hi> coming of Chriſt.
<hi>Firſt,</hi> There is his coming to the particular Day of Judgment, and that is at the Death of every Perſon; For it is in the power of his own hand alone, to fetch away the Souls of Men: The Souls of Men are brought before Chriſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon the Death of the Bodies of Men, to receive their Doom, or Judgment, Heb. 9.27. <hi>It is appointed unto men once to die, and after this the Judgment.</hi>

            <p>The words offer <hi>two</hi> Points of <hi>Doctrine</hi> fairly to our Conſideration.</p>
            <p>Doct. 1. <hi>That it is the great concern of all Men that would be ſaved, to make ready againſt the coming of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doct. 2. <hi>That the uncertain time of Chriſt</hi>'s

            <p>The <hi>firſt Doctrine</hi> is that which we ſhall main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſiſt upon, as ſuiting the preſent ſad occaſion, and the condition of all our Souls. For the proſecution whereof, <hi>three</hi> things ſhall be done.</p>

               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:150002:42"/>2 Pet. 1.10. that is, ſure to themſelves: And when you have done this, then are you ready for the Bridegroom's coming. When you can ſay with <hi>Paul,</hi> and the other Apoſtles, 2 Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth. 5.1. <hi>We know that if our earthly houſe of this Tabernacle were diſſolved, we have a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, an houſe not made with hands, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in the Heavens;</hi> then are you <hi>actually</hi> ready and prepared for the Coming of the Lord. O then try your own ſelves, your ſtates and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, to ſee whether Chriſt be in you or not; Never think that you can be ready in any good meaſure, till you underſtand ſomething of this. Can a man be ready to meet Chriſt, that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not whether he belongeth to Heaven or Hell, to Salvation or Deſtruction? Alas! Such an one is yet ſhort of that degree of readineſs that ſhould be attained, in order to Chriſt's coming.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There is alſo this in <hi>Actual</hi> Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to meet the Lord Jeſus, <hi>viz.</hi> A compleating of the work that God hath given us to do. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man hath his <hi>Generation</hi>-work ſet him of God to do and finiſh; and till this be done, no man is ready for the coming of the Lord. It is ſaid of <hi>David,</hi> Act. 13.46. That
<hi>after he had ſerved his Generation, he fell aſleep.</hi> When a man hath done all his <hi>Generation</hi>-work, he is then fit for Death, and ready for Chriſt. St. <hi>Paul</hi> foreſeeing his Death, hath theſe Expreſſions, 2 Tim. 4.6, 7. <hi>I am now ready to be offered, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:150002:43"/>the time of my Departure is at hand; I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the Faith.</hi> Mark,
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith he is <hi>ready to be offered,</hi> as our
<hi>Tranſlation</hi> hath it (though I know the <hi>Greek</hi> word may be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated otherwiſe): But how proves St. <hi>Paul</hi> that he is ready? Why? <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have finiſhed my courſe,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſaid, I have done all my <hi>Generation</hi>-work, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am ready. O Souls, then, and not till then, are you ready to meet the Lord Jeſus, till you have done all the work which God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you to do in the world. Moſt men (God knoweth) ſpend their time for very Vanity, not conſidering that they have their task to do, &amp; yet they think, when they have lived as long as they can, then there is no more but dying and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into Glory. Poor miſtaken Soul! Thou haſt thy
<hi>Generation</hi>-work to mind, and alſo to compleat; And if thou haſt not ſet about it; and brought it to its <hi>period,</hi> thou art far from the Kingdom of God, and conſequently very unfit to die, and unready to meet the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. Be not deceived, There is much to do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou canſt be ready for Chriſt. Try then what thou haſt done this way, Haſt thou wrought out thine own Salvation with fear and trembling? <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12. Haſt thou filled up thy time with Duty? Haſt thou done all the work of thy Place, Condition, and Relation? <pb n="63" facs="tcp:150002:43"/>If not, thou art not yet ready enough to meet the Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> This <hi>Actual</hi> Readineſs lies alſo in this, <hi>viz.</hi> To have the Affections in ſubjection, and under command, and (as it were) brought under ones feet; That when the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> cometh with a Summons for the Souls appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, then the Soul to have ſo much power over it ſelf, as to ſay, <hi>Ariſe, let me go hence:</hi> So that there needeth no more but Chriſt's <hi>Call,</hi> and the Soul is ready to ſet forward, and to take ſits march to meet him, this now is
<hi>actual</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs. It is ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that when he was called to go into a place that he ſhould afterwards receive for an Inheritance, <hi>he obeyed,</hi> Heb. 11.8. So when Chriſt giveth the Soul a
<hi>Call</hi> to go from hence, for the Soul then to have its Affections ſo ſubdued, and ſo under com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as forthwith to obey the Lord's
<hi>Call,</hi> this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Readineſs indeed. It is alſo ſaid, That the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> upon a voice crying from Heaven to them, <hi>Come up hither,</hi> aſcended to Heaven in a Cloud, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.12. So when Chriſt's voice from Heaven biddeth the Soul come up hither, and the Soul upon the <hi>call</hi> aſcendeth to Heaven, this is Readineſs (<hi>in multis gradibus,</hi> in many legrees) to meet the Lord Jeſus. We read that when the Lord ſhall give the poor <hi>Jews</hi> a <hi>Call</hi> to return, that they ſhall be ſo ready in their Affections to make anſwer to their <hi>Call,</hi> as that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:150002:44"/>they ſhall forthwith make this Reply, <hi>Behold, we come unto thee for thou art the Lord our God,</hi> Jer. 3.22. So when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Return ye Children of Men,</hi> and we anſwer, <hi>Behold we come unto thee,</hi> then are we in a proportionable meaſure prepared to meet the <hi>Lord Jeſus.</hi> The <hi>Centurion</hi> told Chriſt, That his Servants were ſo under his Authority, that if he bid one of them go, he goeth; and if another come, he cometh; and if he bid the <hi>third</hi> do this, he doth it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.9. So if our Affections (like the
<hi>Centurion</hi>'s Servants) be ſo under Chriſt's and our Authority, that if they be bid go, they gp or come, they come; or do this, they do it. This is to be fitted for the <hi>coming</hi> of Chriſt. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> on the other hand now, If the Affections be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> unruly, unſubdued, and <hi>maſterful,</hi> as that the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> will not bend to the <hi>Call</hi> of Chriſt, when eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<hi>ten</hi> pounds, is made Ruler over <hi>ten</hi> Cities. And the ſecond that had made his pound <hi>five</hi> pounds, is made Ruler over <hi>five</hi> Cities. The ſcope of the <hi>Parable</hi> ſeemeth to be this, that according to the improvement of Grace received, ſo anſwerably ſhall the reward be. They that make the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt improvement of Grace, ſhall have the greateſt reward of Glory; and they that make a leſſer improvement thereof, ſhall have leſſer degree of Glory: See for this alſo, 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 15.41, 42. So that from hence to me it is clear, that there are different degrees of Glory, as well as diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent degrees of Grace; And thoſe Saints that concern themſelves the leaſt about <hi>Actual</hi> Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to meet the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> ſhall have the leaſt ſhare in Heavens Glory. And is it a ſmall thing, my Brethren, to deprive your ſelves (through your remiſneſs and negligence) of the weight of Glory? Would you do thus by your ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the things of the world? There are none of you that would hinder your external Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity through your neglect. Be but as wiſe and careful for your Souls, and you cannot then but be making ready for the <hi>Coming</hi> of Chriſt.</p>

I grant, the Almighty ſometimes may, and doth, hide <pb n="77" facs="tcp:150002:51"/>himſelf from his gracious ones, that have made great Conſcience of making Preparation for the <hi>Coming</hi> of their Lord. But ordinarily, thoſe Souls that are the moſt remiſs and careleſs about the work of <hi>Actual</hi> Preparation for the meeting of the Lord
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> are moſtly left and forſaken of him (as to
<hi>actual</hi> favour) in times of trial, and eſpecially in a dying hour. And this is no more but a juſt Puniſhment upon them for their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect: It being moſt equal, that they that have not cared to fit themſelves for Him, ſhould not find Him friendly to them when they ſtand in moſt need of his favour; Then God ſheweth them his back, and not his face, as he did to the
<hi>Jews</hi> in their troubles. I grant, to diſpenſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours this way, belongeth to the Divine Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative; and therefore he both can, and may deal them forth as he pleaſeth, and to whom he pleaſeth. And (poſſibly) ſometimes he may let ſome Souls <hi>ſip</hi> of this Cup, that have not every way carried ſuitably to this favour, Iſa. 57.18. <hi>I have ſeen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him alſo, and reſtore comforts unto him, and to his mourners;</hi> And this is done, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

               <p n="4">4. They run the hazard alſo of entring into great Temptations. Though Satan, when let looſe by the Almighty, will trouble the beſt of Saints, and fill their Spirits with great perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fears, eſpecially in times of Trial, and moſtly in a Dying Hour; when they are left to be tried by him: yet moſt commonly the ſecure, ſlothful, and careleſs Saints are moſt perplexed with his Temptations, at ſuch times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Now if ever, he will endeavour to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaint them. And this he laboureth to do, by ſetting before the eye of their Conſcience, and charging upon them, all their former careleſneſs and remiſneſs in and about their <hi>actual</hi> Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the <hi>Coming</hi> of Chriſt, as not conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a ſtate of Grace. Though before he did ſecretly (yet ſtrongly) perſwade them to the contrary, when he did tempt them to ſlacken the reins, and grow remiſs in the Duties of Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; yet now he appeareth openly to the Conſcience, and chargeth it home upon it, as
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:150002:52"/>that which can no way comport with the ſpirit of a Saint. Hence it is that ſo many, when brought to their dying hour, are ready to caſt away all their hopes of the life to come; though (peradventure) ſome time before, they were groundedly perſuaded that their ſtate was good, and that they had a Right (through Faith in Chriſt) to the purchaſed Inheritance. You ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Saints! that pleaſe your ſelves at preſent in your Remiſneſs, take heed leſt the <hi>Devil</hi> have a field with you before you die. Though you may have your quiet at preſent, through his

And reckon you it nothing to fall into the hands of a mercileſs De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, that will not ſpare you a blow, I warrant you? O fear an After-clap to come upon you, if you do not ſpeedily awake, and ſet about this <hi>Actual</hi> Readineſs for the

                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:150002:90"/>wrapt up in the Life of your hopeful Child.</hi> But <hi>(my Brother,)</hi> it is for us to be ſilent and <hi>mute</hi> under the moſt pinching Providences, and that not from a ſtupid frame, but becauſe we ſhould know that our Father doth all, and He knows what He doth; He is wiſe in heart, and all things done by Him to any of his, ſhall work for good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We are Childiſh Creatures, and when we are out of our Fits of Paſſionate Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, we can ſee as much. It is our Folly and Selfiſhneſs, to ſet more by our own
<hi>tranſient</hi> Comfort, than our Childrens <hi>ſuperlative</hi> Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. I have been ſometimes taken with a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage that I have ſomewhere met with; Namely this, <hi>Would a Father grieve to have his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter married to a King, or rather taken into a Kings boſome, dearly and entirely loving her?</hi> This is the Caſe as to your precious and only Child, She is now in the arms of the Prince of Glory, in his embraces who hath loved her, and waſhed her from her Sins in his own Blood. O Dear Brother! Let not your heart ſay, <hi>The Lord hath dealt bitterly with me; How can I be comforted, wherewith will ye comfort me? The Child is not, and whither ſhall I go?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would ſay <hi>two</hi> things to you, (my Brother) they coming now before me. <hi>Firſt,</hi> God your Father hath done you no wrong.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> He hath done your Daughter no hurt: Now why ſhould you be then ſo caſt down by means of this <pb n="156" facs="tcp:150002:91"/>
               <hi>Snatching</hi> Diſpenſation? (1.) Your Father, I ſay, hath done you no wrong. He hath taken but his own. His own, 1. By his own Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 2. His own by your Donation. 3. His own by Purchaſe and Redemption. 4. By her own free Self-reſignation. It is ſomewhat ſtrange, that God cannot take his own, but He muſt trouble us: <hi>Object.</hi> 1. But I thought the Lord would have lent me this mercy longer. <hi>Reſol.</hi> But, <hi>Firſt,</hi> you had not a word for that. <hi>Secondly,</hi> You had this mercy longer than ſome of your companions had the like. Further, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Lord made this mercy yield more to you for the time you had it, than others have had in many more years of enjoying the ſame mercy for kind. O the revenues of Comfort from her, ſhe bore by handfuls, which you your ſelf do acknowledg.
<hi>Object.</hi> 2. But I am an unſpeakable loſer, O her great uſefulneſs to me every way; I perceive this pincheth you. <hi>Reſ.</hi> And 1. What is here but Selfiſhneſs. But again, 2. You are not an unſpeakable loſer; for ſo long as intereſt holds above, our loſſes are all inconſiderable, not to be accounted of. But 3. Suppoſe you were an unſpeakable loſer; yet ſhe (I dare ſay you do believe it) is an unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able gainer. As for her great uſefullneſs every way, I would only ſay this to that. Her uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to you was from Influence, from above. She was but a Bucket, a Pitcher, and it may be <pb n="157" facs="tcp:150002:91"/>ſhe kept you from the Fountain too much, and this the Lord ſaw: precious Children may be Idols. Come (my Brother) your Father hath done you no wrong, He hath taken but his own, his own out at nurſe with you for a time, during his good pleaſure, and you have been well paid with comfort in her, whilſt you did enjoy her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> And hath your Father hurt your Daughter: Is this to hurt her? 1. To put her to Bed. 2. To put off all her filthy Garments from her. 3. To gratifie her in her own long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſire. 4. To enſhrine her in Glory? Well, (My Brother) what ſhall I write to you? Come, conſider what you have to take comfort in, in this Providence; Pore not on the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of it only (as we are apt to do.) Is this cloud all dark? Methinks here are great light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings for you, I ſay for you. (1.) Your Daughter knew the Lord before ſhe died, ſhe lived before ſhe died. (2.) Your Daughter, ſo I collect from yours, died in the day-time: there was no Cloud, or Night of Darkneſs with her, when ſhe died. (3.) Your Daughter died, but not ſuddenly, not by a violent ſtroke: the Lord took her, ſhe fell aſleep. (4.) Further, Your Daughter (as I perceive) left a Perſume, a ſweet Perfume behind her: Thus, here is Honey for you in this Carcaſs, O take thereof in your hands, and go on eating, and bleſſing God. But what ſtand I upon theſe matters? Queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <pb n="158" facs="tcp:150002:92"/>theſe my Conſolations are anticipated by fuller meaſures from others; And then, beſides; what will ſtick, till God faſten? But however, it is our Duty to viſit the afflicted, and thus only at preſent am I capacitated to viſit you in your Affliction. Now (my beloved Brother) what you requeſt of me for you, I hope ſhall be minded by me; we ſhall remember you, and beg that you may be ſupported of the Lord: And be you confident, That your Father will ſupport you, He knoweth his Peoples Souls in Adverſities. Now the Lord be with you, and let your poor unworthy Brother be remembred by you, and all the Saints with you: O pray for me, that I may work the works of God, while it is called to day. And bleſſed be the Lord for this day of Liberty. Let me be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred to your Wife; to Brother <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> to the whole Church. The <hi>25th</hi> inſtant the Church here will be together, to ſet apart our Brother <hi>E.</hi> (who remembers him to you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doling with you) to Office-place. We ſhould be glad to hear of your affairs from time to time, that ſo accordingly we might have you upon our hearts before the Lord. Brother! I have blotted much Paper you ſee, in pouring out my ſelf to you, O that ſomething from me might refreſh you: The Lord hath ſometimes choſen to do much by fooliſh and weak things. It is much to be a comforter. I will conclude (though <pb n="159" facs="tcp:150002:92"/>ſomewhat abruptly) with that known and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Scripture, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.13, 14.</p>
